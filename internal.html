"<span id="k">Hey there, how are you? Nice to see you here...</span>" I don't know what or who you are looking for but this is me, <b>Luis P. Corchado</b>.
<p>
  In the dawn of my career I was a molecular biologist and biotechnology research assistant, and I had the privilege to be part of one of the oldest academic institutions in the world, the mighty University of Salamanca.
<br />
  Now I am (<s>definetely NOT a SUPERHEROE NOR Breaking</s>) managing projects, developing software and transitioning to the intrincate path of ai applied field. It's been an amazing ride so far because we are living in extraordinary times.
<br/>
